# Educational-Robotic-Platform
A platform to be used in Educational Robotic environment.
The Educational-Robotic-Platform (HeCRE) global architecture includes a Main Module and four Secondary Modules. HeCRE consists of up to four Secondary Modules. Each of these modules is formed by other components that are mentioned in the following subsections. The Main Module includes the FPGA prototype, a Bluetooth communications module, an Arduino Shield port and four Secondary Modules. An Arduino NANO and an Arduino Shield port are part of the Seconday Modules.
There are three design layers including hardware, firmware and software. The Main Module and Secondary Modules are hardware, FPGA firmware is the firmware and Arduino NANO boards software. Furthermore.
